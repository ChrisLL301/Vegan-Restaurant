    <br><br>
    <div style="font-size:1.2vh;" class="blockT2 center">Three great founders all came together. From learning techniques, information, and health skills
    all deriving from plant-based culinary arts! We constructed our restaurant and made it clear what our purpose was, it was serving you our delicious
    foods !! We customized our menu to the perfection your mouths have been awaiting! Due to a strong community in the city, our first and (currently) only location
    is in Los Angeles! With a completed business plan, menu and location, new customers such as yourself poured in!! Vegan Influncer "LettuceMunch4eva" Visited our site
    which boosted sales by a bunch, so thank you "LettuceMunch4eva"! We were prepared for any obstacles that mightâ€™ve come our way such as demand changes.
    But in no time our team prevailed and kept on going. The restaurant you see today is a result of everybodys equal hard work and dedication to delicious, healthy,
    and ethical meals!!</div>

    <div style="font-size:55px;" class="blockT2 center"><b>Why we do what we do</b></div>
    <br><br>
    <div style="font-size:25px;" class="blockT2 center"> The three of us have a multitude of reasons why we chose veganism for both our lifestyle choices and for this restaurant. 
    These reasons brought us closer to not only eachother, but to YOU as well!! Not only is veganism socio-economically better for us, but it takes way less space (1/3rd of what animal agriculture needs). 
    To help the environment even more, we offer our amazing menu with a farm-to-table system. Owning farms not too far from here, we directly overview our entire food delivery process and make sure 
    its always environmentally friendly. We love animals as well, and as to stop the slaughter they experience, we stand up for them. Although many institutes and farms have more ethical ways to get meat,
    the vast majority still uses cruel and unethical methods to produce their meats and treat their animals, factoring veganism as a great alternative in order to help these animals. Lastly its important 
    to know that both American and British organizations approve of our vegan methods as you do it properly, in order to get each nutrient for your body. People with low blood pressure, cholesterol can
    be helped by this diet, and veganism can also prevent certain cancers. So as long as you follow proper guidance, any age can start and live a fulfilling life with a vegan diet and help not only their bodies
    but our beautiful nature surrounding us!!
